# Project Description
Nutshell is a relational database designed to identify, track, and mitigate vulnerabilities on user devices. It stores detailed information about users, their devices, operating systems, running services, software versions, ports, and network protocols. The database also maintains a repository of known vulnerabilities from ExploitDB, including exploit details, risk assessments, and CVSS severity scores. Designed with a structured ERD, it features stored procedures, triggers, indexing for performance optimization, and SQL queries to extract key insights for vulnerability management.
